# SQL Challenge: Employee Data Analysis

## Background

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your first major task is to conduct a research project about employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s. This project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks.

## Instructions

### Data Modeling
- Inspect the provided CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using a tool like [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).
- Design table schemas for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key

### Data Engineering
- Create SQL tables for each CSV file based on the designed schemas.
- Import the CSV data into the corresponding SQL tables.

### Data Analysis
- Answer specific questions about the data using SQL queries.

## Requirements

### Data Modeling (10 points)
- Include an Entity Relationship Diagram or provide table schemas for all tables.

### Data Engineering (70 points)
- Define all required columns for each table.
- Set correct data types for columns.
- Set primary keys for each table.
- Define correct references between related tables using foreign keys.
- Use NOT NULL condition where necessary.
- Define appropriate value length for columns.

### Data Analysis (20 points)
